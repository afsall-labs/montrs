<h1 align="center">MontRS: The Most Comprehensive Full-Stack Rust Framework</h1>

MontRS is a Rust-native, trait-driven framework for building cross-platform applications. It provides a unified, deterministic environment for web, desktop, and mobile, powered by the performance of Leptos and the type safety of Rust.

## Philosophy

MontRS exists because building complex applications requires more than just a UI library. It requires a **predictable architecture**.
- **Determinism**: The same input should always produce the same output, whether in production or testing.
- **Trait-Driven Boundaries**: Features are encapsulated in Plates with explicit interfaces.
- **Agent-first**: Built-in metadata and structured snapshots make MontRS applications natively understandable by agents.

## 🎯 The Golden Path

The "Golden Path" is the recommended workflow for building robust MontRS applications:

1.  **Scaffold**: Start with `montrs new <app-name>` to get a pre-configured workspace.
2.  **Define**: Use `#[derive(Validator)]` to define your data models and validation rules.
3.  **Implement**: Build features as `Plate`s. Define unified `Route`s that bundle your Loader, Action, and View.
4.  **Verify**: Use the `TestRuntime` for in-process, deterministic testing of your entire application spec.
5.  **Ship**: Deploy to your target (Web, Server, or Desktop) using `montrs build`.

## 🧠 How to Think in MontRS

- **Everything is a Trait**: If you want to change behavior (ORM, Auth, Rendering), you implement a trait.
- **Unified Routes**: A single struct defines the path, parameters, data fetching, and visual representation for a URL.
- **The AppSpec is Truth**: Your entire application is defined by a serializable `AppSpec`, making it portable and inspectable.
- **No Magic**: We prefer explicit registration over reflection or global state.

## 🚀 Minimal Example

```rust
use montrs::prelude::*;

#[derive(Validator, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Greeting {
    #[validator(min_len = 3)]
    name: String,
}

struct HelloPlate;

impl Plate<AppConfig> for HelloPlate {
    fn register_routes(&self, router: &mut Router<AppConfig>) {
        router.register(HelloRoute);
    }
}

struct HelloRoute;

impl Route<AppConfig> for HelloRoute {
    type Params = EmptyParams;
    type Loader = HelloLoader;
    type Action = EmptyAction;
    type View = HelloView;

    fn path() -> &'static str { "/hello" }
    fn loader(&self) -> Self::Loader { HelloLoader }
    fn action(&self) -> Self::Action { EmptyAction }
    fn view(&self) -> Self::View { HelloView }
}
```

## 📦 Installing from Source (Local Development)

Since MontRS is not yet published on [crates.io](https://crates.io), you'll need to build and install from source for local development.

### Prerequisites

- **Rust toolchain**: Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). MontRS pins a specific nightly version in `rust-toolchain.toml` — it will be installed automatically on first build.
- **WASM target**: Required for web builds.
  ```bash
  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
  ```

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/afsall-inc/montrs.git
cd montrs
```

### 2. Build the CLI

```bash
cargo build --package montrs-cli
```

The binary will be at `target/debug/montrs` (or `target/debug/montrs.exe` on Windows).

### 3. Install the CLI (Optional)

To make `montrs` available globally:

```bash
cargo install --path packages/cli
```

Alternatively, use `cargo run` from the project root:

```bash
cargo run --package montrs-cli -- <subcommand>
```

### 4. Verify

```bash
cargo run --package montrs-cli -- --help
```

### Development Workflow

Use the `montrs` CLI for common development tasks:

```bash
montrs fmt          # format all Rust and view! code
montrs test         # run all tests
montrs bench        # run performance benchmarks
montrs serve        # start the dev server with hot-reload
montrs build        # build for production
montrs watch        # watch for changes and rebuild automatically
montrs agent check  # run agent-level diagnostics
montrs agent doctor # full health check
```

For linting, use `cargo clippy` directly:

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
```

> **Note for Framework Contributors**: If you're working on MontRS itself, run `montrs agent doctor` after building to verify the environment is healthy.
