//! montrs-icons: Lucide icons for MontRS applications.
//!
//! Provides 1600+ icons as Leptos components, grouped into 42 category features
//! for selective compilation. Prefer the per-icon convenience components
//! (e.g. [`SearchIcon`]) over the generic [`Icon`] component for static usage.
//! Use the [`glyph!`] macro with the generic [`Icon`] when you need a dynamic
//! or reactive glyph.
